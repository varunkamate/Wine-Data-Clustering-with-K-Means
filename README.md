## Wine Data Clustering with K-Means

This project applies **K-Means clustering** on the classic **Wine dataset** to explore patterns and group wines based on their chemical properties. Instead of using labels (supervised learning), the focus is on **unsupervised learning**, where the algorithm discovers structure in the data on its own.

### What’s Inside

* Data preprocessing and feature scaling for clustering
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
* Implementing K-Means to cluster the wines
* Using the **Elbow Method** and **Silhouette Score** to choose the right number of clusters
* Visualizing cluster results and interpreting insights

### Why This Project

It’s a hands-on example of applying K-Means to a real dataset. The notebook is designed to show the full workflow of clustering: from preparing the data, to tuning the number of clusters, to making sense of the results.

### How to Use

Clone the repo, open the notebook, and run through the cells. You can follow the steps directly or adapt them to other datasets to practice clustering.

This project is a good starting point if you want to learn **unsupervised machine learning**, **K-Means clustering**, and **data visualization**.
